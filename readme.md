# P422 Project - Recipe Application

My goal is to create a no muss, no fuss, no long winded story of self actualization preamble, recicipe application.

Features/Goals:
* A database to hold recipes, with keys based on name, primary ingredients (ie. meats or signature vegitables), type of dish, regional/thematic flare (Mediterranean or etc.) 
* A backend with data search functionality based on the keys.
* A splash page with search and random selction based on above criteria. As well as an add.
* A selection page based on search results.
* A recipe page accessible through selection or random.
* An add page accessible through the splash page, that allows new recipes to be added.
